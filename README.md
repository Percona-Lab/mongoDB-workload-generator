# MongoDB Workload Generator

MongoDB Workload Generator was designed to help MongoDB users effortlessly generate data and simulate workloads for both sharded and non-sharded clusters. The generated workloads include standard CRUD operations, reflecting real-world usage patterns of a MongoDB environment.

Additionally, the tool supports the creation of realistic workloads by incorporating all CRUD operations through a set of queries that simulate common usage scenarios. Users can also define custom queries to run against collections created by the tool, further enhancing its flexibility and applicability.

While the tool provides extensive configuration capabilities, it requires minimal setup — only basic connection details are needed. It is user-friendly, does not require compilation, and offers a high level of flexibility.

The application was developed and tested using Python 3. As such, Python 3 is recommended for optimal compatibility. If upgrading is not feasible, modifications to the scripts may be necessary to support older Python versions.

The tool is optimized to leverage as many available CPU cores as you wish and supports configuration of an arbitrary number of threads among, enabling high parallelism and making it ideal for generating large-scale workloads and conducting effective stress tests on MongoDB clusters.


## Configuration

The tool consists of 4 files: 

* [mongodbCreds.py](mongodbCreds.py)
* [mongodbLoadQueries.py](mongodbLoadQueries.py) 
* [mongodbWorkload.py](mongodbWorkload.py)
* [app.py](app.py)

The only required configuration is in [mongodbCreds.py](mongodbCreds.py), where you define the connection details for your MongoDB cluster. The file is self-explanatory and includes examples to help you set up your environment correctly. You may also extend this file to include additional parameters as needed.

Custom queries can be defined in [mongodbLoadQueries.py](mongodbLoadQueries.py), but this is not a requirement. When adding new queries, ensure they target existing collections and fields generated by the tool to avoid runtime errors.

#### Pre-reqs

MongoDB Workload Generator relies on a few additional Python libraries that are not included by default. To ensure proper functionality, please install the following dependencies:

- [faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/) – Used to generate random fictional data, ideal for bootstrapping databases, stress testing, and creating randomized datasets.
- [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) – Enables parallel execution of tasks by leveraging multiple CPU cores.
- [pymongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/current/) – Library for interacting with MongoDB using Python.

To install these libraries, run the following command:

```
pip3 install faker joblib pymongo
```

## Functionality

By default, the workload runs for `60 seconds`, creating `4 threads` and using 1 CPU core. The workload creates a database called `airlines` with a collection named `flights_1` and populates it with documents containing data similar to the sample shown below. (Note: Sharding is not enabled by default.)

```
[direct: mongos] airlines> db.flights_1.findOne()
{
  _id: ObjectId('6806aafca42639c2279450a4'),
  flight_id: 6766976,
  flight_name: 'Flight_kopgt',
  departure: 'Crawfordside',
  arrival: 'Lake Tony',
  gate: 'K10',
  timestamp: ISODate('2025-04-21T16:30:52.512Z'),
  duration_minutes: 523,
  seats_available: 80,
  passengers: [
    { passenger_id: 1, name: 'Kenneth Gallagher', seat_number: '26F' },
    { passenger_id: 2, name: 'Lisa Moran', seat_number: '23B' },
    { passenger_id: 3, name: 'Mark Crosby', seat_number: '1E' },
    { passenger_id: 4, name: 'Mark Roy', seat_number: '22E' },
    { passenger_id: 5, name: 'Mark Nichols', seat_number: '12E' },
    { passenger_id: 6, name: 'Melissa Rivas', seat_number: '27A' },
    { passenger_id: 7, name: 'Andrew Bishop', seat_number: '17A' },
    { passenger_id: 8, name: 'Susan Williams', seat_number: '7F' },
    { passenger_id: 9, name: 'Shannon Cameron', seat_number: '13B' },
    { passenger_id: 10, name: 'Jean Rodriguez', seat_number: '12D' }
  ],
  equipment: {
    plane_type: 'Embraer E190',
    total_seats: 90,
    amenities: [ 'WiFi', 'TV', 'Power outlets' ]
  },
  flight_code: 'FLT-148'
}
```

The default query distribution ratio is as follows:

* 60% SELECT queries
* 20% UPDATE queries
* 10% INSERT queries
* 10% DELETE queries

This default distribution provides a balanced and meaningful baseline for performance testing and stress simulations. However, users are encouraged to adjust these ratios to better align with their specific use cases and workload characteristics.

During execution, the tool generates a real-time report every 5 seconds, showing the average number of queries executed across all utilized CPU cores, along with a detailed breakdown by operation type. At the end of the run, a final summary report is produced, providing statistics on overall workload performance and collection activity ([see sample output below](#Basic-Usage)).


## Usage

The workload is highly configurable at runtime, allowing you to adjust its behavior by modifying the parameters as needed. You can specify these parameters dynamically when executing the workload, as outlined below.

#### Getting help

You can customize various aspects of the workload, such as execution time, the number of threads, query distribution and more, by passing parameters during execution. You can obtain help and a list of all available parameters by running `./mongodbWorkload.py --help` 

```

#### Basic Usage 

Once you have configured the settings to match your environment, you can run the workload without specifying any parameters. This will utilize the default settings, providing a great way to familiarize yourself with the tool and review its output. The default setting is not optimized, this means it will randomly choose between slow and fast queries, so your performance may vary.

#### Advanced Usage

You have a wide range of options available, and the parameters are neither exclusive nor mutually dependent, allowing you to use as many or as few as needed.

1. Collection Name
  - You can choose a different name for your collections. The default name is flights

2. Sharded Clusters

  - If you are running the workload against a sharded cluster, you can specify the `--shard` parameter to automatically enable sharding, create the necessary sharded indexes, and shard the collections. After the initial run, it is not necessary to include the `--shard` parameter in subsequent executions as long as you have not dropped the collections, as the collection will already be sharded (unless you drop the collection, then you'll need to start the workload again with `--shard`).
  - If you run a new workload after the initial workload has been run and create a new collection (see below) without the `--shard` option, the new collection will not be sharded, however, the previous 5 collections will.

3. Multiple collections

  - The workload will create multiple collections when you specify `--collections` with the desired number of collections, for example: `--collections 5`. Each collection will have its index count appended to its name, such as `flights_1`, `flights_2`, `flights_3`, and so on. You can create additional collections even after the initial workload has been run. For example, if you run the first workload with `--collections 5` and then run a new workload with `--collections 6`, a new collection will be created and the workload will run against all 6 of them.

4. Recreating collections

  - If you want to start from scratch you can pass `--recreate` and this will drop and recreate everything for you based on the parameters you provide. Keep in mind you need to provide `--shard` if you wish to shard the collections, as explained above.

5. Query ratio

  - You can adjust the default query ratio to suit your needs. For example, to run 90% SELECT statements instead of the default, use: `--select_ratio 90`. The workload will automatically distribute the remaining 10% across the other query types according to the original query ratio.

6. Workload duration

  - By default the workload runs for 60 seconds. You can chage this by specifying either seconds or minutes, e.g: `--runtime 15s`

7. Batch size

  - The workload performs its inserts in batches of 10 documents. You can change this behavior with a new batch size, e.g: `--batch_size 20`

8. Threads

  - By default the workload uses 4 threads, this can be configured with a new thread count, e.g: `--threads 12`

9. CPUs

  - By default, the workload uses a single CPU. However, you can specify the number of CPUs to utilize for the workload, allowing for high parallelism. This setting, when combined with the thread configuration, can significantly increase traffic to the MongoDB cluster, leading to immense throughput. If you select a number of CPUs greater than the available amount, the workload will automatically configure itself to use the maximum available CPUs., e.g: `--cpu 10`  

10. Skipping certain workloads

  - You can tell the workload to skip certain workloads by using any of the following (these can be used in combination if needed):
    - `--skip_update`         
    - `--skip_delete`         
    - `--skip_insert`        
    - `--skip_select`         

11. Report interval (seconds)

  - You can configure the report inteval from the default 5s, e.g: `--report_interval 1`

12. Record the workload report to a log

  - You can configure the workload to log its output to a file. While the workload will continue to stream its output to the terminal, a log file will also be created for additional analysis, should you choose to enable this option. e.g: `--log /tmp/report.log`

13. Report per CPU stats
  - By default the real-time workload report outputs the stats for all CPUs combined however, you can change this behavior by providing `--cpu_ops`. This will change the default behavior of the real-time reporting to display the AVG OPS per CPU, instead of AVG OPS for all CPUs combined.    

14. Configure queries

  - You can add or remove queries from your workload by editing [mongodbLoadQueries.py](mongodbLoadQueries.py) to suit your requirements (there are a mix of fast and slow queries already provided). The queries for the workload are randomly chosen as the workload progresses, between aggregate (`collection.count_documents(query)`) and select queries (`collection.find(query, projection)`) and slow and fast, unless you use `--optimize`, which prevents the workload from choosing slow queries. 

15. Combine sharded and non-sharded collections in the same workload

  - You can create both sharded and non-sharded collections by following this workflow:
    1. Create a sharded workload by using the `--shard` parameter.
    2. Create another workload without specifying the `--shard` option, but increase the number of collections using `--collections` (make sure the number specified is higher than the current number of collections). For example, if you have 1 collection, you can use `--collections 2` and this would create 1 new collection that's not sharded.

  - This will utilize the existing sharded collections while creating new collections as non-sharded, since the `--shard` option was not provided, but the number of collections was increased with `--collections`.

16. Optimized Workload
  
  - This setting is disabled by default, allowing the workload to run all queries, including both optimized and ineffective queries. To run a more optimized workload, provide the `--optimized` argument when executing the workload. This ensures that queries use the flight ID for retrieval, rather than a range of flight IDs and other less optimal queries Since the flight ID is indexed and serves as the shard key in sharded clusters, using it for queries improves performance and efficiency. In addition, providing this flag will enable find workloads to only run aggregate queries, as these are faster since they do not require sending records back from DB to client.
